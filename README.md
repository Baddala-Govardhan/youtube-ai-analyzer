**a. Challenges faced and how you solved them**

I didn't face any big challenges because i used streamlit the main thing is API keys exceed everytime i need to change the API keys 

**b. Trade-offs made during development**

I choose simplicity over scalability. Instead of a full backend (eg,flask) so everything runs within streamlit to keep it lightweight for demo purpose so this reduces flexibility for handling large scale video analysis and it gives quick response  and easy deployment

**c. What you would improve with more time**
